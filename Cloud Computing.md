Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet (“the cloud”) instead of using local computers or physical servers.



These services include:



* Servers (virtual machines)



* Storage (saving files, databases)



* Networking (connecting systems)



* Databases



* Software and AI tools



🔹 Simple Definition:



Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and applications on remote servers via the internet, rather than your computer’s hard drive.



🔹 Example:



When you use Google Drive, Dropbox, or AWS, your data and applications are stored and managed on cloud servers — not on your own device.



🔹 Main Types of Cloud Computing:



1.IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):

Provides virtual servers and storage.

Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure.



2.PaaS (Platform as a Service):

Provides tools and platforms for developers to build apps.

Example: Google App Engine, Heroku.



3.SaaS (Software as a Service):

Provides software over the internet.

Example: Gmail, Zoom, Salesforce.



🔹 Advantages:



* Cost-effective (pay only for what you use)



* Scalable (easy to increase or decrease resources)



* Accessible anywhere with internet



* Reliable and secure (data backups and updates handled by provider)
