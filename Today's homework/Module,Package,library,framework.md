Difference between Module, Package, Library, Framework.?



1\. Module:

Definition: A module is a single file containing code (functions, classes, variables).

Example 

* In Python:

math.py, os.py, random.py

* A single .js file in JavaScript.



2\. Package:

Definition: A package is a collection of multiple modules grouped inside a folder.

Example

* In Python: a folder with an \_\_init\_\_.py file.
* Example package:

numpy, pandas, requests



3\. Library:

Definition: A library is a collection of packages and modules designed to do specific tasks.

* It provides functions you can call — you control the flow.

Example:

* Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
* JavaScript: React (can be considered a library)



4\. Framework:

Definition: A framework is a complete structure for building applications.

It decides:

* How your project should be organized
* How your code should run
* The flow of the application

This is called Inversion of Control — framework calls your code.

Example:

* Python: Django, FastAPI, Flask
* JS: Angular, Vue, Node.js Express
