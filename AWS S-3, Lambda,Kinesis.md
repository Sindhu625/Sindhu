What is AWS S-3, AWS Lambda, AWS Kinesis.?



1\. AWS S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service):



Full form: Simple Storage Service



Definition:

It’s a cloud storage service by Amazon where you can store and retrieve files (like photos, videos, backups, data files).

Save logs and reports



2\. AWS Lambda:



Definition:

It lets you run code without managing servers.

When a new image is uploaded to S3 → Lambda automatically runs the code and resizes it.



You pay only for the time your code runs.
