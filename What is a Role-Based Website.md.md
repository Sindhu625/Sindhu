What is a Role-Based Website?



A role-based website is a web application where different users have different access levels or permissions based on their roles (like Admin, User, Manager, Guest, etc.).



Example:



Imagine a school management website:



Role	     Permissions



Admin	     Can add/remove teachers, students, view all reports



Teacher	     Can upload grades, view their students



Student      Can see their own grades and assignments



Parent	     Can view their child’s progress



So, depending on who logs in, the website shows different content and allows different actions.



How It Works (Simplified).?



1.User Login – The user logs in using username and password.



2.Role Assignment – The system checks the user’s role from the database.



3.Access Control –



* If the role is Admin, show admin dashboard.



* If the role is User, show user dashboard.



4.Backend Logic – Code verifies the role before performing certain actions (like adding or deleting data).



Benefits:



1\.Improves security (no unauthorized access)



2\.Makes management easier



3\.Personalized experience for users
