Model View Controller(MVC)?

1. Model (Data Part):

The Model handles the data and logic of the application.

It talks to the database and stores, updates, or retrieves data.

Example: A “User” model stores user details like name and email.

2. View (Display Part):

The View is what the user sees — the interface or output.

It shows the data from the Model in a readable way.

Example: A webpage or app screen that displays the user’s name and profile picture.

3. Controller (Manager Part):

The Controller connects the Model and View.

It takes input from the user, tells the Model what to do, and then updates the View.

Example: When you click “Save,” the Controller tells the Model to save data, then refreshes the View.

Example:
When you fill a form and click “Submit”:

The Controller takes your input.

The Model saves it to the database.

The View shows a success message.
