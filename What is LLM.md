What is LLM.?



* Definition:



A Large Language Model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can understand, generate, and respond to human language.

It’s trained on huge amounts of text data (like books, articles, and websites) so it can learn grammar, facts, reasoning, and even some logic.



* How it works:



It uses deep learning, especially a type of neural network called a Transformer.



The model learns patterns in language — for example, how words and sentences usually appear together.



When you type a question, the model predicts the most likely next words to form a meaningful answer.



* Examples of LLMs:



1\.GPT-4 / GPT-5 – by OpenAI



2\.Gemini – by Google



3\.Claude – by Anthropic



4\.LLaMA – by Meta (Facebook)



* Uses of LLMs:



1\.Chatbots (like ChatGPT, Gemini)



2\.Text summarization



3\.Translation



4\.Code generation



5\.Content writing



6\.Data analysis



7\.Question answering
