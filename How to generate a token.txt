How to generate a token.?

Token generation is a key concept in token-based web applications, used for authentication and security (especially in APIs).

Hereâ€™s a simple explanation ðŸ‘‡

ðŸ”¹ What is a token?

A token is a unique string of characters (like a digital key) that proves the identity of a user or client after login.
Itâ€™s usually generated by the server and sent to the client after successful authentication.

ðŸ”¹ How tokens work (simple steps):

User logs in â†’ sends username & password to the server.

Server verifies â†’ if valid, it generates a token.

Token is sent to client â†’ client stores it (e.g., in local storage or cookies).

Client sends token with each request â†’ server checks the token for authorization.

If valid, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.
