Virtual ports in software servers.?

In software servers (like web servers, database servers, etc.), there arenâ€™t a fixed number of virtual ports â€” instead, they are defined by the TCP/IP protocol, which allows:

ðŸ”¹ 65,536 ports in total (0 to 65,535)

These are virtual ports, used by software to send and receive data through the network.

ðŸ”¹ Port ranges:

0â€“1023 â†’ Well-known ports (used by common services)

Example:

HTTP â†’ port 80

HTTPS â†’ port 443

FTP â†’ port 21

SSH â†’ port 22

1024â€“49151 â†’ Registered ports (used by user or vendor applications)

49152â€“65535 â†’ Dynamic/Private ports (used temporarily for client connections)

So, in total, a software server can use any of the 65,536 virtual ports, depending on configuration â€” but typically only a few specific ones are open for particular services.
