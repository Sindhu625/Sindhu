What is API Gateway.?

An API Gateway is a server that acts as an entry point for all client requests to your backend services. It’s commonly used in microservices architecture to manage, route, and secure API calls. Here’s a clear breakdown:

Key Functions of an API Gateway:

1.Request Routing

Directs incoming API requests to the appropriate backend service.

Example: /user requests go to the User Service, /order requests go to the Order Service.

2.Protocol Translation

Converts between protocols if needed (e.g., HTTP to WebSocket, or REST to gRPC).

3.Security

Handles authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT tokens, OAuth).

Can enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse.

4.Aggregation

Combines responses from multiple services into a single response.

Example: A dashboard API might fetch user data, order history, and notifications all in one call.

5.Caching

Can cache responses to reduce load on backend services and improve performance.

6.Monitoring & Logging

Tracks API usage, errors, and performance metrics.
