HTTP,HTTPS,TCP IP,UDP.?

1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):

Used for transferring web pages between a browser and a web server.

When you visit a website like http://example.com, your browser uses HTTP to get the page.

It’s not secure — data is sent as plain text.

Works on port 80.

2. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):

It’s HTTP + SSL/TLS encryption (secure version of HTTP).

Protects data like passwords, card details, etc. from hackers.

Used by almost all modern websites.

Works on port 443.

3. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol):

The foundation of the Internet.

It defines how data is sent and received between computers.

TCP ensures reliable delivery — data arrives in correct order.

IP handles addressing — decides where to send the data.

4. UDP (User Datagram Protocol):

A faster but less reliable protocol than TCP.

Doesn’t check if data reaches or arrives in order.

Used where speed matters more than accuracy, like:

Online gaming

Video streaming

Voice calls
