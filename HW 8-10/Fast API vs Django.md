Fast API vs Django.?



* Fast API:



1.Used mainly for building APIs and backend services.



2.Asynchronous and very fast in performance.



3.Based on ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface).



4.Requires knowledge of Python type hints.



5.Has minimal built-in features — you add libraries as needed.



6\.Great for microservices, AI, and real-time applications.



7\.No built-in admin panel or ORM (you choose your own).



8\.Easier to deploy as lightweight services.



* Django:



1\.A full-stack web framework (frontend + backend).



2\.Synchronous by default, slightly slower than Fast API.



3\.Follows MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture.



4\.Has many built-in features — ORM, admin panel, authentication, etc.



5\.Easier for beginners to start web development.



6\.Ideal for large websites or complex web apps.



7\.Strong community and documentation.



8\.Best suited for monolithic applications (all-in-one).
