Microservice.?



* Definition:



A microservice is a small, independent part of a big application that does one specific job.

All these small parts (microservices) work together to make the full application.



* Example:



Imagine an e-commerce app like Amazon:



1.Cart Service – manages the shopping cart



2\.Payment Service – handles payments



3\.User Service – stores user info



4\.Order Service – manages orders



Each one is a microservice — separate, but they communicate with each other.



* How it works:



1\.Each microservice runs independently.



2\.They talk to each other using APIs (like REST APIs).



3\.You can develop, test, and deploy each service separately.



* Advantages:



1\.Easy to maintain and update (you can fix one service without touching others).



2\.Scalable — you can increase the resources for just one service.



3\.Different teams can work on different services.



* Disadvantages:



1\.Harder to manage many services together.



2\.Needs proper communication between services.



3\.More network and security setup required.
