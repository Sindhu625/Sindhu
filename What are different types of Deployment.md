What are different types of Deployment.?



1\. On-Premises Deployment



* Software is installed on local servers or computers within an organization.



* Control: Full control over hardware and data.



* Example: Internal company ERP system.



2\. Cloud Deployment



Software is hosted on cloud servers and accessed via the internet.



Types:



* Public Cloud – Shared infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure).



* Private Cloud – Dedicated infrastructure for one organization.



* Hybrid Cloud – Combination of public and private cloud.



3\. Hybrid Deployment



* Mix of on-premises and cloud deployment.



* Useful for sensitive data on-prem and scalable apps on cloud.



4\. Rolling Deployment



* Gradually replaces old versions with new versions without downtime.



* Example: Updating microservices one at a time.



5\. Blue-Green Deployment



* Two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (new).



* Switch traffic to Green after testing.



6\. Canary Deployment



* Releases new version to a small group of users first, then full rollout.



* Helps catch issues before affecting all users.



7\. Continuous Deployment (CD)



* Automatically deploys every code change that passes tests to production.



* Often used with CI/CD pipelines.
