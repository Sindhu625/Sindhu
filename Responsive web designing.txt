Responsive web designing.?

Responsive Web Designing (RWD) is a web design approach that makes websites look and work well on all devices — desktops, tablets, and mobile phones — by automatically adjusting layout, images, and content.

🔹 In simple terms:

Responsive design means the website “responds” to the screen size and orientation of the user’s device.

🔹 Key Features:

Flexible Layouts – Use of fluid grids that resize elements proportionally.

Responsive Images – Images scale and fit within the screen.

Media Queries – CSS rules that apply different styles for different screen sizes.

Mobile-first Design – Designing for small screens first, then expanding for larger screens.

🔹 Example:

If you open a website on your phone and it fits perfectly without zooming or scrolling sideways — that’s responsive design.
