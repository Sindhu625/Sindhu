What is Vibe Coding.?



* Definition:



Vibe coding” is a term coined by AndrejKarpathy in February 2025 to describe a new way of writing software, where the developer shifts from typing every line of code to 



giving high-level, natural-language prompts to an AI, letting the AI generate much of the boilerplate and implementation.



* Example:



“Make a website that shows today’s weather.”

AI: writes HTML, CSS, and Python/JavaScript code automatically.



* How it works:



You tell your idea to the AI (like ChatGPT or Replit Ghostwriter).



AI generates the code.



You check if it works and fix small things.



You don’t have to write every line yourself — just go with the “vibe” (the idea).



* Advantages:



Fast — saves time.



Easy for beginners.



Helps create apps or websites quickly.



* Disadvantages:



You may not understand all the code.



Sometimes AI makes mistakes.



Not good for big or secure projects.
