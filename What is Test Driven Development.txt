What is Test Driven Development.?

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you write tests before writing the actual code.

Process (TDD Cycle):

1.Write a test → for a small function or feature.

2.Run the test → it fails (since the code doesn’t exist yet).

3.Write code → just enough to make the test pass.

4.Run tests again → ensure all pass.

5.Refactor → clean up the code while keeping tests passing.

This cycle is called Red → Green → Refactor.

Benefits:

Fewer bugs

Cleaner and more reliable code

Easier refactoring

Better design
