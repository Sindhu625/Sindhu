* Port



A port is a communication endpoint number used by computers to identify specific services or applications.



It helps the operating system know which program should handle incoming or outgoing data.



Example:



Port 80 → for HTTP (web traffic)



Port 443 → for HTTPS



Think of a port like a door number in a building — it tells where to deliver data.



* Socket



A socket is the combination of IP address and port number (like 192.168.1.10:8080).



It represents the connection point between two devices communicating over a network.



Example:



A client connects to a server using a socket.



Think of a socket as the connection between two doors — one on your computer and one on the server.
