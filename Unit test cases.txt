Unit test cases.?

Unit test cases are small automated tests written by developers to check if individual parts (functions, classes, or modules) of a program work correctly.

Purpose:

Find bugs early

Ensure code works as expected

Make future changes safe

Frameworks:

Python → unittest, pytest

Java → JUnit

JS → Jest

Good test: simple, fast, independent, clear result.
