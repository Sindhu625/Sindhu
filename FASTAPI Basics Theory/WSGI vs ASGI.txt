What is WSGI.?
WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)
is the old standard for Python web applications.

Simple Words:
WSGI allows Python web apps to talk to a web server (like Gunicorn or uWSGI).

But WSGI has a limitation:

1.It can handle only one request at a time per worker
2.It does NOT support asynchronous (async/await) code
3.Good for simple or traditional web apps

Used by:
Flask
Django (older versions)

What is ASGI?
ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)
is the modern version of WSGI.

Simple Words:
ASGI allows Python apps to handle many requests at the same time using async/await.

Supports:
1.Asynchronous apps
2.WebSockets
3.Real-time communication
4.Faster, more scalable APIs

Used by:
1.FastAPI
2.Django 3+ (via ASGI)
3.Starlette
