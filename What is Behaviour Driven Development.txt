What is Behaviour Driven Development.?

BDD (Behavior Driven Development) is a software development approach that focuses on how the software should behave — written in a way that non-technical people can understand.

Definition:

BDD extends Test Driven Development (TDD) by writing tests in natural language (plain English) that describes user behavior.

Format:

BDD uses the Gherkin syntax:

Given <some context>
When <an action happens>
Then <expect a result>
